ARIMA and Seasonal ARIMA

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Averages (ARIMA) and Seasonal ARIMA models for time series forecasting. The general process of building and using ARIMA models is outlined below.

Process for ARIMA Models

1. Visualize the Time Series Data
   - Plot the time series data to understand the underlying trends, seasonality, or noise.

2. Make the Time Series Data Stationary
   - Ensure the data is stationary by removing trends and seasonality. Differencing or transformation methods can be used.

3. Plot the Correlation and AutoCorrelation Charts
   - Use Autocorrelation (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation (PACF) plots to identify the lags that will help in selecting model parameters.

4. Construct the ARIMA Model
   - Based on the ACF and PACF plots, choose the appropriate parameters (p, d, q) for the ARIMA model.

5. Use the Model to Make Predictions
   - After fitting the model, use it to make future predictions and evaluate its accuracy.
 
 Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Statsmodels
- Matplotlib

Usage
To run the model:
1. Install the required dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib
